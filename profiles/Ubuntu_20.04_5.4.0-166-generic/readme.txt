Volatility 2 linux profile for Ubuntu 20.04

This profile was generated for linux memeory dump:

Linux version 5.4.0-166-generic gcc version 9.4.0 (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2)

I used Ubuntu 20.04.6 to generate the profile with linux-image-5.4.0-166-generic linux-headers-5.4.0-166-generic install

this profile can be used on TryHackMe room Profiles https://tryhackme.com/r/room/profilesroom

you need to copy the profile plugins/overlays/linux which will be under your volaitliy installation. in my case case is /home/username/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/volatility/plugins/overlays/linux where username is your user account (it can be also volatility/plugins/overlays/linux, depend of your installation)
