YouTube videos walk through /write ups for TryHackMe path: Web Application Pentesting

Every day you interact with web applications. Just reading the information here means you are using a web application! Understanding how to test web applications is a critical skill required by almost every pentester! Even if you want to specialise in testing other systems like networks or cloud, a solid baseline in web application testing will greatly assist you on this journey. This path covers key topics that you need to understand for web application testing, such as:

Authentication Attacks<br />
Injection Attacks<br />
Advanced Server-Side Attacks<br />
Advanced Client-Side Attacks<br />
HTTP Request Smuggling<br />

Authentication<br />
