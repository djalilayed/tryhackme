YouTube videos walk through /write ups for TryHackMe path: Web Application Pentesting

Every day you interact with web applications. Just reading the information here means you are using a web application! Understanding how to test web applications is a critical skill required by almost every pentester! Even if you want to specialise in testing other systems like networks or cloud, a solid baseline in web application testing will greatly assist you on this journey. This path covers key topics that you need to understand for web application testing, such as:

    Authentication Attacks
    Injection Attacks
    Advanced Server-Side Attacks
    Advanced Client-Side Attacks
    HTTP Request Smuggling
